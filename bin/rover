# Rover CLI Helper Script
#
# This script provides a convenient wrapper around vendor/bin/robo for Rover commands.
# It automatically detects if you're using Laravel Sail and routes commands appropriately.
#
# Usage:
#   ./rover rover:clear
#   ./rover rover:test
#   ./rover list

# Check if we're using Laravel Sail
if [ -f ./vendor/bin/sail ]; then
    # Run through Sail
    ./vendor/bin/sail bash -c "vendor/bin/robo $*"
else
    # Run directly
    vendor/bin/robo "$@"
fi
